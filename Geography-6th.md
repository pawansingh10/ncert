### Chapter-1    **The Earth in the Solar System**
***

- **SKY**
   - The whole sky is filled with tiny & shining objects - some are bright, others dim


- **Moon**
   - Full moon night is called ***Poornima***

   - New moon night is called ***Amavasya***

   - Difference of both is 15 days

- **Celestial Body (खगोलीय पिंड)**
   - Sun, Moon & All those things or objects shining in the night sky is called **Celestial bodies**

- **Stars**
   - Some celestial bodies are very **big & hot**.
   - Made up of **Gases**
   - Having thier own **heat & light**, which they emit in large amount are ***Stars***

> **The SUN is a STAR**

- **Constellations (नक्षत्र/तारों का समूह)**
   - While watching the night sky, we may notice various patterns formed by different groups of stars.These are called ***conse=tellations***
   - Ursa Major or Big Bear
   
   - Small Bear or Sapta-Rishi (Seven Sages) 
   > Sapta-Rishi : It is group of seven stars

   
- In ancient time, people used to determine directions during the night with the help of stars
   - The North star indicates the **North Direction**, also called **Pole Star**
   - It always remains in the same position in the sky


- **Planets**
   - Some celestial bodies do not have thier own heat & light
   - They are lit by the light of the stars
   - Such bodies are called ***Planets***

   - 'Planetai' greek word means 'Wanderers'

   - The Earth on which we live is a Planet.
   - It gets all its heat & light from the Sun, which is our nearest star

   > **The moon that we see in the sky is Satellite**


- **The Solar System (सौर मंडल)**
   - The Sun, eight planets, Satellites & some other celestial bodies known as **asteroids & meteoroids** (क्षुद्रग्रह और उल्कापिंड)

- Asteroid Belt which lies in between mars & jupiter

- **Michael (asteroid) Johnson**

- **Sun**
  - The Sun is in the centre of Solar System
  - It is huge & made up of extremely hot gases
  - It provides the pulling force that binds the Solar System
  - Ultimate source of Heat & light
  - ***The Sun is about 150 million km away from the Earth*** 

- **Planet**
  - 8 planets in our solar system
 
  - In order of thier distance from **Sun : Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus & Neptune**
 
  ```javascript
     My Very Efficient Mother Just Served Us Nuts
  ```
 
  - All the 8 planets moves around the Sun in fixed path, these path are elonated. They are called **Orbit**

  > ***Mercury is nearest to the Sun, takes only 88 days for one round***
 
  > **Venus** is considered as **Earth's twin** because it's size & shape are very similar to the Earth
  - **V-2** -> Earth

 - **Pluto**
   - Till Aug 2006, Pluto was also considered a Planet
   - However in a meeting of **International Astronmical Union** a decision was taken that Pluto is like other calestial objects called as **dwarf planets**



- **Earth**
  - 3rd nearest planet to Sun
  - 5th Largest planet acc to size
  - It is slightly flattened at poles that's why it's shape is discribe as **Geoid** means earth like shape

  - Conditions favorable to support life probably found only on the Earth
  - **Neither too Hot nor too Cool**, having **Water & Air**, which are very essential for survival
  - From the outer space, the earth appears **Blue** because it's 2/3rd surface is covered by water, therefore called as **Blue Planet**

```javascript
    Those who study the Celestial bodies & thier movements are called Astronomers.
    Aryabhatta was famous astonomer of ancient India
    
    Brahmagupta a scholar and mathematician in AD 628 first time defined zero and its operation and developed a symbol for it which is a dot underneath the numbers
    
    Aryabhatta a great mathematician and an astronomer used zero in the decimal system
    
    On July 20, 1969, Neil Armstrong became the first human to step on the moon
    
    Kalpana Chawla was the first India-born woman astronaut to go to space

- **Geography** English word originated from two greek words ***Ge*** means Earth and **graphia** means Writting



- **Moon**
  - Our Earth has only one satellite i.e, **Moon**
  - It's diameter is only one-quarter (1/4th) that of the earth
  - It appears so big because it's nearer to our planet than other celestial bodies
  - It is about **3,84,400 km** away from us
  - Moon moves earth in 27 days, exactly same time to complete one spin, that's why only one side of moon is visible to us on the earth

  - Doesn't any favarable conditions for life
  - No water no Air
  - It has Mountains, plains & depression on its surface

- **Asteroids क्षुद्र ग्रह**
  - Apart from the Stars, Planets & Satellites, there are numerous tiny bodies which also moves around the Sun, these bodies are called ***asteroids***
  - They found between the **orbit of Mars and Jupiter**
  - Scientists are of the view that asteroids are parts of a planet which exploded(विस्फोट) many years back


- **Meteoroids उल्कापिंड**
  - The smallest piece of rocks which move around the Sun are called ***meteoroids***
  - Sometimes these meteoroids come near the earth and tend to drop upon it
  - During this process due to Friction with the air they get heated up & burn
  - It causes a flash of light
  - Sometimes, a meteor without being completely burnt, falls on the earth and creates a Hollow(खोखले)

 - ~~**Whitish Broad Band/White Glowing Path across the Sky on a clear starry night**~~
   - It is a cluster of millions of stars
   - This band is the **Milky way Galaxy**
   - Our Solar System is a part of this galaxy

   - In ancient time, it was imagined to be a river of light flowing in the sky.Thus, it was named **Akash Ganga**

- **Galaxy**
   - A galaxy is a huge system of billions of stars and clouds of dust & gases
   - There are millions of such galaxies that make the **Universe**
   
   - It is difficult to imagine how big the universe is.
   - Scientists are still trying to find out more & more about of it.
   - We are not certain about its size, but we know you and I belong to this universe

### Chapter-2    **Latitudes & Longitudes**
***
- **Globe**
  - Our planet is **not sphere**. It is slightly **flattened at the North Pole & South Pole** also **Bulge(उभाड़) in the Middle**
  - Geoid Shape
  - **Globe** is a true model of the earth
  - Globe is not fixed, It can be rotated the same way as top spin/potter's wheel is rotated
  - On the globe, **Countries, Continents and Oceans** are shown in thier correct size
  
- **Difficult to describe the location of a point on a sphere like Earth**
  - Need certain points of references & Lines to find out the Location of place
  
  - A Niddle is fixed through the globe in a tilted manner which is called its **axis**
  
  - Two points on the globe through which niddle passes are Two Poles : **North Pole & South Pole**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124561288-58e93200-de5b-11eb-92e9-e3e624dda444.png)
  
  - The real earth has no such needle. It moves around its axis, which is an imaginary line
  
  - Another imaginary line running on the globe divides it into two equal parts. This line is known as the **equator(भूमध्य रेखा)** 

  - [x] 🔵 The Northern Half of the Earth is called **Northern Hemisphere**
  - [x] 🔵 The Southern Half of the Earth is called **Southern Hemisphere**
  - [x] 🔵 They are both equal halves


### Latitudes
  - All parallel circle from the equator up to the poles are called **Parallel of Latitudes **
  - [ ] ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124575181-cc457080-de68-11eb-9744-0950619e856b.png)
  - Latitudes are measured in degrees
  - The equator represents the zero degree latitude
  - The distance from the equator to either of the poles is one-fourth of a circle round the earth, it will measure **¼**th of 360 degrees, i.e. 90°
  - All parallels north of the equator are called ‘north latitudes' & similarly all parallels south of equators are called 'south latitudes'


- **Important Parallel of Latitude**
  - Besides the Equator (0°), the North Pole (90° N) & the South Pole (90° S)
  
  - There are 4 other parallel of latitudes
  - 🟢 1. **Tropic of Cancer कर्क रेखा (23½° N in northern Hemisphere)**
  - 🟢 2. **Tropic of Capricorn मकर रेखा (23½° S in southern Hemisphere)**
  - 🟢 3. **Arctic Circle आर्कटिक वृत्त (66½° north of the equator)**
  - 🟢 4. **Antarctic Circle अण्टार्कटिक वृत्त (66½° south of the equator)**
  
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124582830-0403e680-de70-11eb-865d-5c4758f787f1.png)


- **Heat Zone of the Earth**

- 🔴 **Torrid Zone उष्ण क्षेत्र**
- 🔴 **Temparate Zone समशीतोष्ण क्षेत्र**
- 🔴 **Frigid Zone ठंडा क्षेत्र**

- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124583906-3b26c780-de71-11eb-9d76-fe7683b54de2.png)

### Longitudes
- To fix the position of any place, it is necessary to know something more than the Latitudes of the place
- In order to locate them precisely, we must find out how far east or west these places are from a given line of reference running from the North Pole to the South Pole
- These lines of references are called the meridians of longitude,

- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124584940-6c53c780-de72-11eb-94ee-0c5c47b51fd0.png)

- **Prime Meridian**
   - Unlike parallels of latitude, all meridians are of equal length. Thus, it was difficult to number the meridians.
   - Hence, all countries decided that the count should begin from the meridian which passed through Greenwich, where the British Royal Observatory is located. This meridian is called the **Prime Meridian.**
   - Its value is 0° longitude and from it we count 180° eastward as well as 180° westward

   - The Prime Meridian and 180° meridian divide the earth into two equal halves, the **Eastern Hemisphere(E)** and the **Western Hemisphere (W)**.

> Earth 360° in 24 hrs, 15° in 1hr , 1° in 4 min

- **Why do we have Standard Time?**
  - The Local time of places which are on different meridians are bound to differ
  - For Example:- It will be difficult to prepare a time-table for Trains/Aeroplanes which cross several longitudes
  - The Local time at the specific meridian is taken as the Standard Time for the whole Country, known as ***Indian Standard Time (IST)*** 
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124587517-5267b400-de75-11eb-8286-76241cf3410d.png)

- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124588201-2862c180-de76-11eb-8d47-58356421337b.png)














### Chapter-3    **Motion of the Earth**
***
- Earth has two types of motion 
- **Rotation Vs Revolution**
  - 🟥 **Rotation is the movement of the earth on its axis**
  - 🟩 **The moment of the earth around the Sun in a fixed path or orbit is called Revolution**
  
- **Day-Night concept**
  - The axis of the earth which is an imaginary line, makes an angle of 66½° with its **orbital Plane**
  > ***The plane formed by the orbit is known as the Orbit Plane***
  
  - Earth receives light from the Sun. Due to the spherical shape one half portion experience Light at a time while another half portion experience NIght
  
  - The circle that divides the day from night on the globe is called the **Circle of illumination**
  
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124599713-98c40f80-de83-11eb-8c6d-4d1d5fda72f4.png)
 
  - The earth take about 24 hrs to complete one rotation around its axis. This period of rotation is known as **Earthday**, this is the daily motion of the earth.

  - ```javascript
       the ancient indian astronomer Aryabhatta had stated that Earth is Round and Rotate on its Axis   
    ```
    
  - The second motion of the earth around the Sun in its orbit is called **Revolution**
  
  - It takes 365¼ days (365 days ==1 year ignore 6 hrs for the sake of convenience) to revolve around the Sun 
  
  - 6 hrs saved every year are added to make 24 hrs == 1 Day over a span of 4 years, Thus every 4th year Feb is of 29 days instead of 28, such a year has 366 days is called as **Leap Year**  
  
  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124601963-0709d180-de86-11eb-9f53-7834f4214ea4.png)
  
  - In above picture it is clear that the earth is going round the sun in an **Elliptical Orbit** throughout its orbit, the earth is inclined in the same direction.
  
  - A year is usually divided into 🟡**Summer**, ⚪**Winter**, 🟢**Spring** and 🔵**Autumn** seasons
  - Seasons change due to the change in the position of the earth around the Sun


- **Summer Solstice ग्रीष्म संक्रांति**
  - 21st June, the Noerthern Hemisphere is titled towards the Sun.
  - The rays of Sun fall directly on the Tropic of Cancer
  - As a result these area receive more heat
  - The longest day and the shortest night at these places occur on 21st June. At this time in the Southern Hemisphere all these conditions are reversed. It is winter season there. The nights are longer than the days. This position of the earth is called the **Summer Solstice**


- **Winter Solstice शीतकालीन अयनांत**
  - On 22 Dec, the Tropic of Capricorn receives direct rays of the sun as the South pole tilts towars it.
  - Sun Rays fall vertically at Tropic Of Capricorn longer portion of South Hemisphere gets light. Therefore It's summer in the southern hemisphere with longer day and shorter nights. The reverse happen in the Northern Hemisphere. This position of the earth is called **Winter Solstice**


- **Equinox विषुव**
   - on 21 March and 23 Sept, direct rays of the Sun fall on the equator.
   
   - At this position neither of the poles is tilted towards the sun. So the whole earth experience equal days & equal nights. This is called **Equinox**
   
   - on 23 Sept, It is Autumn season in the Northern Hemisphere and Spring Season inthe Southern Hemisphere.
   
   - The opposite in the case of 23 March, when it is Spring in the Northern Hemisphere and Autumn in the Southern Hemisphere
   
   - Days & Nights are changes in Seasons because of the Rotation & Revolution of the earth repectively

### Chapter-4    **Maps**
***

- A globe can be useful when we want to study the earth as whole, But when we want to study only a part of the earth as about Country, State, District, town, Village we use **Map**

- ***Map is a representation or drawing of earth's surface***

- Maps are very useful for various purposes

- Map provide more information tha a Globe 

- One Map shows a small area & few facts while another Map contains as many facts as a book

> **When many Maps are put together we get an ATLAS** 
  

- 🔴**Physical Map**
   - Map showing natural features of the earth such as Mountains, Plateaus, plains , rivers, oceans etc are called **Physical or Relief Map**

- 🔴**Political Map**
   - Map showing  cities, town, villages and different countries and states of the world with thier boundaries are called **Political Map**

- 🔴**Thematic Map**
   - Some Maps focus on specific information such as Road Map, Rainfall Map, Map showing distribution of forests, industries etc are known as **Thematic Map**
   
 
- **There are three components of the Map**
   1. Distance
   2. Direction
   3. Symbol
   
- ▶️**Distance**
   - Maps are drawing which reduce the entire world to fit on a sheet of paper
   - 🏀**Scale** is the ratio between Actual Distance on the ground and Distance shown in the Map
    1. Small Scale Map
    2. Large Scale Map 

- ▶️**Direction**
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124641018-dd63a100-deab-11eb-9245-28f64cb365e4.png)
    
    - Maps contain an Arrow mark with the letter like N , If we know North then we can find others
    
    - There are Major four direction:-
     1. North
     2. South
     3. East
     4. West They are called **Cardinal Points**
     5. Other 4 intermediate directions are :
     6. North East
     7. South East
     8. North west
     9. South West
    
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124641097-f4a28e80-deab-11eb-9cbd-9c1fb3694c97.png)
    
    - **Compass** is an instrument used to find main direction. Its magnetic needle always points towards North-South direction
    - ![image](https:// user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124641174-05530480-deac-11eb-8c1f-c99d0e5f94df.png)

 
 - ▶️**Symbol**
    - 3rd important component of Map, It's not possible to draw a map of actual shape/size of different features such as buildings, roads, bridges, trees, railway lines, etc
    - So these are shown by using Symbols such as certain Letters, Shades, colors, pictures & lines 
    - These Symbols give a lot of information in a limited space
    
    - With the use of these symbol, Map can be drawn easily simple to read
    - Map have a Universal Language which can be understood by all
    - There is an international agreement regarding the use of Symbols. These are called **Conventional Symbols**
    - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124646538-6978c700-deb2-11eb-8f34-2770076a5ea3.png)


- Various colours are used for the same purpose. For Example:-
   - Blue for 💙 Water Bodies 
   - Brown for 🤎 Mountain
   - Yellow for 💛 Plateau
   - Green for 💚 Plain

- **Sketch**
   - A Sketch is a drawing mainly based on memory and spot observation and not to scale
   - A rough drawing is drawn without scale and called is called a Sketch Map

- **Plan**
   - A plan is a drawing of small area on a large scale.
   - A large scale map gives a lot of information but there are certain things which we may want to know like Length, Bridth of a room which cannot be shown in Map
   - At that time, we can refer drawings drawn to scale called a **plan**


- ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124649874-aba40780-deb6-11eb-8a45-75e472a5d0b0.png)













### Chapter-5    **Major Domains of the Earth**

- ```javascript
    Biosphere is the narrow zone where we find Land, Water and Air together which contain all forms of life
  ```
- | Greek Words|
  |------------|
  |**Lithos ->  Stone**|
  |**Atmos  ->  Vapour**|
  |**Hudor  ->  Water**|
  |**Bios   ->  Life**|

- **Lithosphere**
  - The solid portion of the earth is called **Lithosphere**
  - Comprises of Rocks of the Earth's Crust & the thin layer of Soil that contains nutrients elements which sustain organism
  - There are 2 major division of earth's surface
   1. The Large landmasses are known as the **Continents**
   2. The huge waterbodies are called **Ocean Besins**

  > ***All the oceans of the world are connected with one another***

  - The level of SeaWater remains the same everywhere
 
  - Elevation of Land is measured from the level of Sea which is taken as Zero(0)
