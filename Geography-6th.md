### Chapter-1    **The Earth in the Solar System**
***

- **SKY**
   - The whole sky is filled with tiny & shining objects - some are bright, others dim


- **Moon**
   - Full moon night is called ***Poornima***

   - New moon night is called ***Amavasya***

   - Difference of both is 15 days

- **Celestial Body (खगोलीय पिंड)**
   - Sun, Moon & All those things or objects shining in the night sky is called **Celestial bodies**

- **Stars**
   - Some celestial bodies are very **big & hot**.
   - Made up of **Gases**
   - Having thier own **heat & light**, which they emit in large amount are ***Stars***

> **The SUN is a STAR**

- **Constellations (नक्षत्र/तारों का समूह)**
   - While watching the night sky, we may notice various patterns formed by different groups of stars.These are called ***conse=tellations***
   - Ursa Major or Big Bear
   
   - Small Bear or Sapta-Rishi (Seven Sages) 
   > Sapta-Rishi : It is group of seven stars

   
- In ancient time, people used to determine directions during the night with the help of stars
   - The North star indicates the **North Direction**, also called **Pole Star**
   - It always remains in the same position in the sky


- **Planets**
   - Some celestial bodies do not have thier own heat & light
   - They are lit by the light of the stars
   - Such bodies are called ***Planets***

   - 'Planetai' greek word means 'Wanderers'

   - The Earth on which we live is a Planet.
   - It gets all its heat & light from the Sun, which is our nearest star

   > **The moon that we see in the sky is Satellite**


- **The Solar System (सौर मंडल)**
   - The Sun, eight planets, Satellites & some other celestial bodies known as **asteroids & meteoroids** (क्षुद्रग्रह और उल्कापिंड)

- Asteroid Belt which lies in between mars & jupiter

- **Michael (asteroid) Johnson**

- **Sun**
  - The Sun is in the centre of Solar System
  - It is huge & made up of extremely hot gases
  - It provides the pulling force that binds the Solar System
  - Ultimate source of Heat & light
  - ***The Sun is about 150 million km away from the Earth*** 

- **Planet**
  - 8 planets in our solar system
 
  - In order of thier distance from **Sun : Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus & Neptune**

  ```
 
  - All the 8 planets moves around the Sun in fixed path, these path are elonated. They are called **Orbit**

  > ***Mercury is nearest to the Sun, takes only 88 days for one round***
 
  > **Venus** is considered as **Earth's twin** because it's size & shape are very similar to the Earth
  - **V-2** -> Earth

 - **Pluto**
   - Till Aug 2006, Pluto was also considered a Planet
   - However in a meeting of **International Astronmical Union** a decision was taken that Pluto is like other calestial objects called as **dwarf planets**



- **Earth**
  - 3rd nearest planet to Sun
  - 5th Largest planet acc to size
  - It is slightly flattened at poles that's why it's shape is discribe as **Geoid** means earth like shape

  - Conditions favorable to support life probably found only on the Earth
  - **Neither too Hot nor too Cool**, having **Water & Air**, which are very essential for survival
  - From the outer space, the earth appears **Blue** because it's 2/3rd surface is covered by water, therefore called as **Blue Planet**

- **Geography** English word originated from two greek words ***Ge*** means Earth and **graphia** means Writting



- **Moon**
  - Our Earth has only one satellite i.e, **Moon**
  - It's diameter is only one-quarter (1/4th) that of the earth
  - It appears so big because it's nearer to our planet than other celestial bodies
  - It is about **3,84,400 km** away from us
  - Moon moves earth in 27 days, exactly same time to complete one spin, that's why only one side of moon is visible to us on the earth

  - Doesn't any favarable conditions for life
  - No water no Air
  - It has Mountains, plains & depression on its surface

- **Asteroids क्षुद्र ग्रह**
  - Apart from the Stars, Planets & Satellites, there are numerous tiny bodies which also moves around the Sun, these bodies are called ***asteroids***
  - They found between the **orbit of Mars and Jupiter**
  - Scientists are of the view that asteroids are parts of a planet which exploded(विस्फोट) many years back


- **Meteoroids उल्कापिंड**
  - The smallest piece of rocks which move around the Sun are called ***meteoroids***
  - Sometimes these meteoroids come near the earth and tend to drop upon it
  - During this process due to Friction with the air they get heated up & burn
  - It causes a flash of light
  - Sometimes, a meteor without being completely burnt, falls on the earth and creates a Hollow(खोखले)

 - ~~**Whitish Broad Band/White Glowing Path across the Sky on a clear starry night**~~
   - It is a cluster of millions of stars
   - This band is the **Milky way Galaxy**
   - Our Solar System is a part of this galaxy

   - In ancient time, it was imagined to be a river of light flowing in the sky.Thus, it was named **Akash Ganga**

- **Galaxy**
   - A galaxy is a huge system of billions of stars and clouds of dust & gases
   - There are millions of such galaxies that make the **Universe**
   
   - It is difficult to imagine how big the universe is.
   - Scientists are still trying to find out more & more about of it.
   - We are not certain about its size, but we know you and I belong to this universe

### Chapter-2    **Latitudes & Longitudes**
***
- **Globe**
  - Our planet is **not sphere**. It is slightly **flattened at the North Pole & South Pole** also **Bulge(उभाड़) in the Middle**
  - Geoid Shape
  - **Globe** is a true model of the earth
  - Globe is not fixed, It can be rotated the same way as top spin/potter's wheel is rotated
  - On the globe, **Countries, Continents and Oceans** are shown in thier correct size
  
- **Difficult to describe the location of a point on a sphere like Earth**
  - Need certain points of references & Lines to find out the Location of place
  
  - A Niddle is fixed through the globe in a tilted manner which is called its **axis**
  
  - Two points on the globe through which niddle passes are Two Poles : **North Pole & South Pole**

  - ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/47448422/124561288-58e93200-de5b-11eb-92e9-e3e624dda444.png)
  
  - The real earth has no such needle. It moves around its axis, which is an imaginary line
  
  - Another imaginary line running on the globe divides it into two equal parts. This line is known as the **equator(भूमध्य रेखा)**
